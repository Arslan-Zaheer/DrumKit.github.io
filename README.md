Concepts that I used in this DrumKit Website:
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
DOM Manipulation.

So the way that this works is that we've got a number of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum set.
And when you click on any of these buttons, you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.In addition, you can also use the keys on the keyboard.
